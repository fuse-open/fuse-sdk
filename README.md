Fuse SDK is part of the [Fuse Open](https://fuseopen.com) project, a set of open-source tools and libraries for cross-platform mobile app development.

You can build native mobile user interfaces using the easy to learn [UX markup language](https://fuseopen.com/docs/ux-markup/ux-markup.html), and add JavaScript or TypeScript for business logic. UX is a declarative, XML based language for expressing user interfaces, layout, effects and motion, where animation is a first class citizen, and where you can easily produce very advanced visuals and user interfaces.

You can interface with lower level code via the very powerful [Uno programming language](https://fuseopen.com/docs/uno/uno-lang), a C#-like language where you can seamlessly access any native API in Java, Objective-C and C/C++, implement new Fuse components, or just write some superfast code. Uno compiles down to native C++ and is one of the fastest and most versatile programming languages around.

For rapid development, you can even build and test apps directly on your development machine. Fuse apps run on Linux, Mac and Windows, in addition to Android and iOS.

## Install

```shell
npm install fuse-sdk
```

This will install Fuse SDK, including [`uno`](https://github.com/fuse-open/uno) and [a set of libraries](https://github.com/fuse-open/fuselibs) used to build [Fuse](https://fuseopen.com) apps.
